# DB-NYPD
### Objectives
This database application is designed to manage and analyze crime incidents handled by the New York Police Department(NYPD).
The system incorporates six main entities: NYPD, Dispatch_Duration, Incident, Outbreak_time, Location, and Radio_Code. NYPD represents patrol units assigned to boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island) as shown in the plain-english text description in the E/R diagram, each identified by unique patrol borough IDs. Dispatch_Duration logs timestamps of when NYPD units were dispatched and arrived at crime scenes. Incident records crime events, including event ID, crime in progress, level of offense (felony, misdemeanor, or violation), and the description of the crime. Outbreak_time captures temporal information, such as the exact and ending date and time of incidents. Location stores spatial data such as location (i.e., inside, opposite of, front of, or rear of), premises (i.e., grocery store, resident, or street), geospatial coordinates (X and Y midblock coordinates), latitude, and longitude. Latitude and longitude of New York City have specific ranges, denoted in the plain text english description in the E/R diagram. Radio_Code records communication codes used during incidents.
The system also establishes eight relationships: Call, Add_System, Close, Send, Monitor, Arrive, Located_at, and Happened_at. The three relationships, Call, Add_System, and Close, represent when the incidents are reported, added to the system, and closed, respectively. For these three relationships, these three events only occur once per incident to the NYPD, necessitating both key and participation constraints to convey: ‘Each incident has to be called, added to system, or closed by/to the NYPD exactly one time.’ For the Send relationship, the radio code can be sent at least once depending on the status of the crime. For example, if there is new information that needs to be shared or a new police department to be shared with about the crime, there will be a new radio code sent which enables multiple radio codes to be sent for a specific incident. Likewise, for the Monitor relationship, the particular incident can be monitored at least one time depending on their needs by the department in charge, which is denoted by the jurisdiction description. The jurisdiction description indicates that the incident should be monitored by either police department or transit police as given in the plain English text description. For the Arrive relationship, crime location is arrived at by at least one department from the NYPD which explains the participation constraint. For instance, if the incident is so serious that more than one NYPD unit should be dispatched at the crime scene, there can be multiple timestamps of arrival to the crime location. Likewise, when the NYPD is dispatched multiple times, there will be multiple dispatch durations so there is a participation constraint for Dispatch_Duration, as well. Lastly, Located_at and Happened_at are relationships explaining where the incident was located and when it occurred, respectively. Each incident has to occur at one specific place or timestamp, represented by using both key and participation constraints.
